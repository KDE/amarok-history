  - plays all formats supported by aRts, including mp3, ogg,
    audio CDs, streams
  - audio effects, like reverb and compressor
  - compatible with the .m3u and .pls formats for playlists
  - nice GUI, integrates into the KDE look, but with a unique touch
 .
 Both aRts and GStreamer support is available in packages amarok-arts and
