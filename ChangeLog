      (BR 99627)
    * The number of podcasts items would be limited even when the user didn't
      set it. (BR 114353)

      Playlist Browser.
    * On Context Browser, when showing a cached lyric, "add", "search", and
      "open in external browser" buttons wouldn't work. "Open in External

      with SQLite, which could lead to 100% CPU usage. (BR 104447)
    * Tabbing between items and cells in the playlist while editing them now

       now with various keypresses going to the correct places

       process (inconsistent recursive behavior), please keep the encapsulation, it's a
       good thing (tm)

  ADD: viswidgetv2.  it seems a lot smoother on my machine.
       its quite easy to tweak the dynamics is needed.  is accessible the same as the other
       widgets, just click until it appears (though it looks the same as the original widget
       it just acts differently) - piggz (www.piggz.co.uk)
  ADD: combo with history and completion for dir/file chooser
  ADD: in configure.in.in for checking the version of TagLib, if compiled from CVS, if not,
       then show, that it uses bundled version of TagLib - Stormy
  FIX: font dialog sizing issues
  ADD: resume playback option. Using this means your track starts up again where you left it
       last time you quit amaroK. Excellent feature for us developers :-)

  added restarting of artsd on first program start to make sure it registers
    the new mcopclasses
  fixed possible compile error in viswidget.cpp
  amaroK uses much less CPU now than it used to. This was mainly achieved by
    using a new FFT-analyzer module, which I took from Noatuns "Winskin"-plugin,
    and modified slightly to my needs. Also some other optimizations were made,
    which improved the standby performance, when no song is playing. I'm still
    not satisfied with overall performance, tho, but it seems that most of the
    load is produced by the aRts code itself, so this will rather be difficult
    to improve.
  fixed crash when "next" or "previous" was pressed without a track
    loaded
  thanks to valgrind I was able to find and squish some serious bugs,
    most of which were related to pointers. to sum it up: pointers are evil.
    valgrind is great.
  lots of UI-changes in the main widget. uses a background pixmap now, a
    custom font and widget for the time-display, and generally looks better
  fixed issues with the liquid skin. unfortunately, there seems to be no way
    to display pushbuttons correctly with a black background under liquid. so,
    until I find a solution for that, the expandbutton widget doesn't look quite
    as cool as it used to. maybe I should ask mosfet about this..

VERSION 0.50:
  renamed 0.15 to 0.50

VERSION 0.15:
  playing streams now works! *yipeeee*
  fixed tons of bugs in aRts playing code. i think i got it right now.
  fixed loading and saving of playlists. can cope with all protocols now.

    Whitehawk Stormchaser for that one :)

  implemented use of arts-software-mixing, in case hardware-mixing
  (/dev/mixer) doesn't work

  changed the direction of the volume-slider. maximum is now at the top
  added automatic saving of current playlist on exit
  added previous/next track
  added two radiobuttons in the playerwidget for toggling the
    playlist/equalizer on and off. admitted, the equalizer doesn't yet exist, so
    it's just a dummy button :P
  added popup-menu for the playerwidget. opens on
    right mouse button. this menu finally replaces the ugly menubar.
  added some icons (from noatun) for the player-buttons instead of text
  added pause function
  changed most names in the source to comply with the
    (unofficial?) KDE c++ coding standard (using the prefix "m_" for member
    attributes and so on). This was real slave-work :/
  cleaned up code in several classes
