amaroK ChangeLog
================
(c) 2002-2004 the amaroK authors.


VERSION 1.0.1:
  FIX: Compile issue for KDE < 3.2.1 users. Sorry :(

VERSION 1.0:
  FIX: Plugin versions are validated. Prevents crashes with ancient plugins.
  FIX: Configure now checks for gtk/gdk headers for the XMMSwrapper.
  REM: Removed cover download feature for this release.
  FIX: Do not crash if an unreadable dir is added to the collection.
  FIX: Check database-sanity on startup and recreate broken tables (BR 83205).
  FIX: CollectionBrowser was broken, when amaroK was running "localized".
  FIX: TitleProxy hogging 100% CPU when unable to connect to server.
  CHG: Bumped GStreamer requirement to 0.8.1.
  ADD: Glowing player window icons.
  ADD: amaroK finally remembers if it was hidden on exit.

       retrieval and uses less memory.

  FIX: Crash on AMD64 due to assumption about pointer size.
  CHG: SQLite library sourcecode now included with amaroK.
  CHG: The collection-thread now inserts its data in a temporary database while
       scanning, which allows us to safely use the collection in the meantime.
       This is done by two concurrent sqlite-connections (thread-safe). Wrote a
       new class named CollectionDB, which handles the database communication
       for the collection.
  ADD: URLDrag from Playlist, so you can drag and drop to xmms. Doesn't work with

       song anymore, but let it be randomly selected (only when random mode is on!)
  CHG: Random Mode now respects the playlist filter and only picks items, which are
       currently visible in the playlist. Also removed a crash situation.
  CHG: Removed the search-token index. Searching now iterates through the playlist,
       offering direct and specific access to the metadata.
  FIX: Bug where fill-down would cause lots of extra tags to be written when a search is
       in progress (BR 79482).
  FIX: Defect in plugin framework code, leading to a crash on some systems
       during engine plugin initialization.
  FIX: Restoring current playlist on startup (BR 79436, BR 79439).
  ADD: Searching the Collection with a filter.
  FIX: BrowserWin's QLabels are painted white in amaroK's own color scheme.

       through the list of recently played songs.
  ADD: TitleProxy searches for a free local port (contributed by Stefan Gehn)
  CHG: Random Mode now stores the recently played songs in a buffer, which prevents

       so it sort of faded in reverse (==crap)
  ADD: tag reading in separate thread

  added restarting of artsd on first program start to make sure it registers
    the new mcopclasses
  fixed possible compile error in viswidget.cpp
  amaroK uses much less CPU now than it used to. This was mainly achieved by
    using a new FFT-analyzer module, which I took from Noatuns "Winskin"-plugin,
    and modified slightly to my needs. Also some other optimizations were made,
    which        improved the standby performance, when no song is playing. I'm still
    not satisfied with overall performance, tho, but it seems that most of the
    load is produced by the aRts code itself, so this will rather be difficult
    to improve.
  fixed crash when "next" or "previous" was pressed without a track
    loaded
  thanks to valgrind I was able to find and squish some serious bugs,
    most of which were related to pointers. to sum it up: pointers are evil.
    valgrind is great.
  lots of UI-changes in the main widget. uses a background pixmap now, a
    custom font and widget for the time-display, and generally looks better
  fixed issues with the liquid skin. unfortunately, there seems to be no way
    to display pushbuttons correctly with a black background under liquid. so,
    until I find a solution for that, the expandbutton widget doesn't look quite
    as cool as it used to. maybe I should ask mosfet about this..

VERSION 0.50:
  renamed 0.15 to 0.50

VERSION 0.15:
  playing streams now works! *yipeeee*
  fixed tons of bugs in aRts playing code. i think i got it right now.
  fixed loading and saving of playlists. can cope with all protocols now.
  fixed a bug in EffectWidget.cpp, that gave a compile error on some systems.
  Converting QString into std::string was not donecorrectly. Thanks to
    Whitehawk Stormchaser for that one :)
  changed project name to "amaroK" and built new project-file

VERSION 0.14 (internal):
  implemented use of arts-software-mixing, in case hardware-mixing
  (/dev/mixer) doesn't work
  fixed crash when play was pressed without selecting a file
  changed the direction of the volume-slider. maximum is now at the top
  added automatic saving of current playlist on exit
  added previous/next track
  added two radiobuttons in the playerwidget for toggling the
    playlist/equalizer on and off. admitted, the equalizer doesn't yet exist, so
    it's just a dummy button :P
  added popup-menu for the playerwidget. opens on
    right mouse button. this menu finally replaces the ugly menubar.
  added some icons (from noatun) for the player-buttons instead of text
  added pause function
  changed most names in the source to comply with the
    (unofficial?) KDE c++ coding standard (using the prefix "m_" for member
    attributes and so on). This was real slave-work :/
