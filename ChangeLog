      be enabled or disabled form the new service config screen. Services that
      are not loaded will not degrade performance or increase memory usage.
      The service frameworks also offers for free, or makes it very simple to
      add features such as cached albumcover downloads, searching and filtering
      to the individual services. Services can also be track providers, meaning
      that if amarok recieves a url that one of the services knows how to
      handle, they will be presented with all the metadata that the servie can
      provide.

    * Shoutcast service: The shoutcast list from previous versions of Amarok has
      been reimplemented as a service.

      simple demo scripts.
    * Playlist Framework: The Playlist Browser can now contain
      Playlists/Podcasts/Streams from any mediadevice/service/collection in

    * When generic media devices were specified manually, transferred files
      would not always get converted to VFAT-friendly names if they were on a
      VFAT filesystem.
    * When using ATF, tags in MP3 files would be written as ID3v2 only and
      existing ID3v1 tags would be stripped, which could lead to media devices
      and tagging libraries that were not ID3v2.4-aware to report that no tag
      existed.  Now both tags are written with identical data.

       through the list of recently played songs.

  added restarting of artsd on first program start to make sure it registers
    the new mcopclasses
  fixed possible compile error in viswidget.cpp
  amaroK uses much less CPU now than it used to. This was mainly achieved by
    using a new FFT-analyzer module, which I took from Noatuns "Winskin"-plugin,
    and modified slightly to my needs. Also some other optimizations were made,
    which improved the standby performance, when no song is playing. I'm still
    not satisfied with overall performance, tho, but it seems that most of the
    load is produced by the aRts code itself, so this will rather be difficult
    to improve.
  fixed crash when "next" or "previous" was pressed without a track
    loaded
  thanks to valgrind I was able to find and squish some serious bugs,
    most of which were related to pointers. to sum it up: pointers are evil.
    valgrind is great.
  lots of UI-changes in the main widget. uses a background pixmap now, a
    custom font and widget for the time-display, and generally looks better
  fixed issues with the liquid skin. unfortunately, there seems to be no way
    to display pushbuttons correctly with a black background under liquid. so,
    until I find a solution for that, the expandbutton widget doesn't look quite
    as cool as it used to. maybe I should ask mosfet about this..

VERSION 0.50:
  renamed 0.15 to 0.50

VERSION 0.15:
  playing streams now works! *yipeeee*
  fixed tons of bugs in aRts playing code. i think i got it right now.
  fixed loading and saving of playlists. can cope with all protocols now.

    Whitehawk Stormchaser for that one :)

  changed the direction of the volume-slider. maximum is now at the top
  added automatic saving of current playlist on exit
  added previous/next track
  added two radiobuttons in the playerwidget for toggling the
    playlist/equalizer on and off. admitted, the equalizer doesn't yet exist, so
    it's just a dummy button :P
  added popup-menu for the playerwidget. opens on
    right mouse button. this menu finally replaces the ugly menubar.
  added some icons (from noatun) for the player-buttons instead of text
  added pause function
  changed most names in the source to comply with the
    (unofficial?) KDE c++ coding standard (using the prefix "m_" for member
    attributes and so on). This was real slave-work :/
  cleaned up code in several classes
  fixed problem where subwidgets got keyboard focus and were drawn dark with
    the liquid style. switched off focus completely, since it's not needed for
    this type of application
