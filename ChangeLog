    * xine-engine was reporting bogus tracklengths for ogg vorbis. (BR 102547)
      Same fix applied to GStreamer-engine, where some users were having
      similar troubles.


VERSION 1.2.3:

      CollectionBrowser.
    * You can mark/unmark albums as compilations via CollectionBrowser's
      right-click contextmenu.

    * Adding a compilation disc from ContextBrowser was broken.
    * GStreamer-engine: Reduced the gap when switching to next track without
      crossfading.
    * GStreamer-engine: amaroK was swallowing the beginning of a track when

  CHANGES:
    * Add 25-track and 50-track smart-playlists.
    * Update current-track icons to include greater padding.
    * The contextbrowser now uses data:-URLs instead of temp image files, so
      they cannot be left on disk when amaroK terminates unexpectedly, and the
      Konqueror/Universal sidebar can show them when amaroK is not running.

  BUGFIXES:

    * amaroK could fail to build if the whole kdeextragear-1 module was
      compiled, due to conflicts with K3B on the MusicBrainz check. (BR 100906)
    * Images shown on OSD where incorrect for action notifications.
    * The handbook translations were not built when amaroK was installed from

    * GStreamer-engine can now play vorbis radio streams properly, with
      full metadata support. (BR 89821)
    * GStreamer-engine now uses the "decodebin" autoplugger, which fixes
      the lag issues that some users had during crossfading. (BR 99570)

  added restarting of artsd on first program start to make sure it registers
    the new mcopclasses
  fixed possible compile error in viswidget.cpp
  amaroK uses much less CPU now than it used to. This was mainly achieved by
    using a new FFT-analyzer module, which I took from Noatuns "Winskin"-plugin,
    and modified slightly to my needs. Also some other optimizations were made,
    which improved the standby performance, when no song is playing. I'm still
    not satisfied with overall performance, tho, but it seems that most of the
    load is produced by the aRts code itself, so this will rather be difficult
    to improve.
  fixed crash when "next" or "previous" was pressed without a track
    loaded
  thanks to valgrind I was able to find and squish some serious bugs,
    most of which were related to pointers. to sum it up: pointers are evil.
    valgrind is great.
  lots of UI-changes in the main widget. uses a background pixmap now, a
    custom font and widget for the time-display, and generally looks better
  fixed issues with the liquid skin. unfortunately, there seems to be no way
    to display pushbuttons correctly with a black background under liquid. so,
    until I find a solution for that, the expandbutton widget doesn't look quite
    as cool as it used to. maybe I should ask mosfet about this..

VERSION 0.50:
  renamed 0.15 to 0.50

VERSION 0.15:
  playing streams now works! *yipeeee*
  fixed tons of bugs in aRts playing code. i think i got it right now.

  changed the direction of the volume-slider. maximum is now at the top
  added automatic saving of current playlist on exit
  added previous/next track
  added two radiobuttons in the playerwidget for toggling the
    playlist/equalizer on and off. admitted, the equalizer doesn't yet exist, so
    it's just a dummy button :P

    right mouse button. this menu finally replaces the ugly menubar.
  added some icons (from noatun) for the player-buttons instead of text
  added pause function
  changed most names in the source to comply with the
    (unofficial?) KDE c++ coding standard (using the prefix "m_" for member
    attributes and so on). This was real slave-work :/
  cleaned up code in several classes
  fixed problem where subwidgets got keyboard focus and were drawn dark with
    the liquid style. switched off focus completely, since it's not needed for
    this type of application

VERSION 0.13 (internal):
  added cute animated pushbuttons with sub-menus
  added saving playlists
