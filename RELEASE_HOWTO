Please do the following:

1.  Checkout a fresh copy of amarok, its docs and po; cd into the root
2.  Update APP_VERSION in amarok/src/amarok.h
3.  Update the version in amarok/amarok.lsm
4.  find -name CVS -o -name .cvsignore -exec rm {} \;
5.  export WANT_AUTOMAKE=1.6
6.  make -f Makefile.cvs
7.  rm -rf autom4te.cache config.h config.log
8.  pushd amarok; mv README TODO INSTALL ChangeLog AUTHORS ..; popd
9.  mv ../kdeextragear-1 ../amarok-VERSION
10. tar cjf ../amarok-VERSION.tar.bz2 ../amarok-VERSION
11. test for default configure, --enable-final, separate build directory
12. get some other people to test

ONCE HAPPY WITH THE TARBALL:

13. upload to ftp://upload.sf.net/incoming
14. release via sourceforge
15. wait for berkus to appear (can take days) and get him to update kde-apps.org
16. send a release email to kde-announce
17. drink a few pints, have some fun on #amarok

If you must change anything about the tarball you need to email
binner@kde.org in case the md5sum changing would break Konstruct.

TODO
    MD5sum procedure
    automate some of this with a dist target?
